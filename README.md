# Demo
The demo for Autoaction is available on `demo.ipynb`

Dataset configuration is from `{adult, student, credit100k, credit1m}`

To add own customized configuration for other datasets, execute

```
from dataConfig import dataLoader
dl = dataLoader()
dataset = dl.customized_loader(
        group_attrs,
        other_attrs,
        actionable_attrs,
        agg_attr,
        fit_attrs,
        path,
